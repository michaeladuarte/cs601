#Styled Biography - Assignment 2

Using only HTML 5 and CSS (no JavaScript or other languages):

You will be building upon your Assignment 1 submission. Make a copy of your
three (3) page website and style it according to the requirements outlined below.

1. Every page must be styled using the same external style sheets to
provide a consistent look and feel across all pages.

2. Two (2) style sheets will be required to accompany your HTML pages from
Assignment 1.

a. One (1) of the style sheets must focus on being used to display
your content on the computer’s screen.

b. The other style sheet must be used to present the page for effective
printing purposes. Note: You don’t actually have to print the page
on paper, you can “print” it as a PDF document.

c. The CSS declarations within these two (2) style sheets should
provide at least three (3) distinct differences in how the pages are
presented based on the differences in output medium (computer
screen vs. printed page)

3. Use selectors to style all appropriate elements on all pages using CSS.

a. Each element selected should have at least one property:value pair
assigned to it. Providing more than one property:value pair for each
element is encouraged and will be acknowledged as extra effort.

b. Examples of elements that are not appropriate to apply styles to
include: doctype, html, head, title, and a few select others. Check
with your facilitator if you are unsure or if you would like to request
a reasonable exception from this requirement.

4. Be creative or at least show your facilitator that you spent some
considerable time thinking about and planning out the appearance of your
website. You could be creative with colors and whitespace, with font types
and sizes, special alignments and positioning, page layout,
navigation/menu appearance, etc.

5. Show us that you know how to use CSS effectively.

7. You cannot use a responsive web design framework for this assignment.
