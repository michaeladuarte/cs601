            My name is Michael Duarte and I am currently part of the Solutions Architecture organization at Acquia in Boston, MA. In this role, I function as the technical counterpart of the account executives I partner with. I am responsible for the technical win of a sale so this means its my job to ensure that we set our customers up with the right Acquia solution in line with their technical requirements. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Systems from the University of Detroit Mercy. During my undergraduate studies I chose to concentrate in software production and management.

            I am currently enrolled in the Master of Science program in Computer Information Systems at Boston University. During my studies I chose to focus on courses around web development, project management, and computer networks. I am set to graduate from the program in May 2019. My goal after graduation is to continue building on my skills and developing as a technologist.
